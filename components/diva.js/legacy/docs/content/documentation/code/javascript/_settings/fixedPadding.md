The number of pixels of padding between pages and on the left and right sides
of pages. Only used if [`settings.adaptivePadding`](#adaptivePadding) is set
to 0. If the width of the pages is sufficiently smaller than the width of the
document viewer, then the width will vary; however, this setting will always
dictate the minimum width when adaptive padding is set to 0.
