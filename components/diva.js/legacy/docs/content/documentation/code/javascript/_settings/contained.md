This setting controls the position of the fullscreen icon. If set to true, as
in `demo/integrated-demo.html`, then the `relative-position` class will be
added to the container element (setting the container element's position to
`relative`, and the slider section of the toolbar will be
moved over slightly to make room for the fullscreen icon. Otherwise, the
fullscreen icon will simply appear at the top left corner of the page.
