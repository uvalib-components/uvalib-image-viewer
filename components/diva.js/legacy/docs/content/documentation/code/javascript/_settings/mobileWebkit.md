This setting is determined by checking if `window.orientation` is defined. If
so, then the device is probably some sort of mobile or tablet device. The name
`mobileWebkit` was chosen because all of the testing was done on iOS and
Android, but this setting should cover those using other mobile/tablet devices
as well.
