{% load extras %}

What exactly constitutes the "document viewer pane" is illustrated in the
diagram below:

{% docs_image "document-viewer-pane" %}

In fullscreen mode, this is the entire screen, minus the vertical scrollbar on
the right.

The height and width of this pane are stored as a means of determining whether
or not certain pages should be loaded.
