{% load extras %}

The number of milliseconds to wait for the AJAX request to be returned before
showing a throbber (loading indicator icon) in the middle of the document
viewer pane, as in the following screenshot:

{% docs_image "throbber" %}

This is useful if a user is on a slow network connection or if the divaserve
script is slow to respond.
