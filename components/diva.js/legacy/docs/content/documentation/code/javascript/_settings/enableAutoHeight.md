This setting controls automatic height detection. If set to false, the document
viewer will not dynamically resize based on the height of the window (only
outside of fullscreen mode; the document viewer will always dynamically resize
in fullscreen mode). Enabling automatic height detection is only recommended if
the viewer is the only element on the page, or if there is nothing beneath it.
Consequently, this is disabled by default.
