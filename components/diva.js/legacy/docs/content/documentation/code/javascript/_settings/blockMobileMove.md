By default, users viewing the document from a touch device (e.g. an iPad) are
unable to move the webpage, to give it more of an app-like feel. This also
results in users being unable to scroll the page, which is fine if the document
viewer is the only element on the page; if this is not the case, then this
behaviour is undesired, in which case it can be disabled by setting
`blockMobileMove` to false.
