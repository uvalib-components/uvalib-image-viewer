If set to false, the document viewer will not dynamically resize based on the
width of the window (only outside of fullscreen mode; the document viewer will
always dynamically resize in fullscreen mode). To ensure that the viewer is
always horizontally centred, set the horizontal margins to `auto` in the CSS
(e.g. `margin: 0 auto`).
