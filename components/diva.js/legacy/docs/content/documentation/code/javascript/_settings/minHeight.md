If the `.diva-outer` element has a `min-height` attribute (as defined in the
stylesheet, or programmatically using Javascript prior to the instantiation of
the document viewer) then `settings.minHeight` will be set to that. The height
of the document viewer cannot be made any smaller than this when the window is
resized.
