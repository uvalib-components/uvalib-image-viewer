The title is determined from the name of the directory containing the images,
with all dashes and underscores converted to spaces and title-case applied. For
example, `some-folder` and `some_folder` would both become "Some Folder".

If [`settings.enableAutoTitle`](#enableAutoTitle) is enabled, then this title is
shown on the page within a div with class `.diva-title`. To prevent it from
showing up, simply set `settings.enableAutoTitle` to false.
