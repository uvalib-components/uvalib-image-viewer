Used when determining the amount to scroll when jumping to a page or changing
the zoom level. Also used to determine the top offset when creating a page div
(as they are absolutely-positioned). Consists of an array of `n` elements,
where `n` is the number of pages in the document; each element is the height
above the corresponding page.
