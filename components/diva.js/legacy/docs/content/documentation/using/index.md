Although the viewer was designed to be simple to use, there are quite a few
features whose usage (or even existence) may not be obvious to someone using
it. This section of the documentation aims to offer a comprehensive listing of
all the features of diva.js, complete with screenshots and explanations.

Here, you can find instructions on using diva.js from a desktop browser as well
as from a touch device. Additionally, we have a table listing support for
various browsers.
