Setting up diva.js requires setting up two different parts: the backend,
consisting of the image server and the data server, and the frontend,
consisting of the HTML, Javascript, stylesheets and images.

To set up the backend, you will need root access to a server or otherwise have
the ability to install software, and will also need access to a server capable
of running either PHP or Python processes (it could be the same server).

To set up the frontend, you simply need access to a server from on you can
host HTML, stylesheet, Javascript and image files. You can alternatively
integrate the diva.js frontend into a more complicated system, such as a CMS
(like Drupal) or a web framework (like Django, Tornado).
