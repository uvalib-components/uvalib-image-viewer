## Developer version

If you want to get the developer version of diva.js, complete with source
files, unit tests, build scripts, and documentation, use the following download
links. The source for the most recent release (the `master` branch) can be
found here:

* [Zip file](https://github.com/DDMAL/diva.js/zipball/master)
* [Compressed tar file](https://github.com/DDMAL/diva.js/tarball/master)

You can find the latest snapshot of the code in the `develop` branch here:

* [Zip file](https://github.com/DDMAL/diva.js/zipball/develop)
* [Compressed tar file](https://github.com/DDMAL/diva.js/tarball/develop)

### Using git

Alternatively, if you wish to get the entire development history (including
both the master and the develop branch) using git, you can use the following
command:

```
git clone git://github.com/DDMAL/diva.js.git
```

The `master` branch contains the latest release, while the `develop` branch has the latest, bleeding-edge code, and should be considered be unstable.
